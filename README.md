# tamagotchi
This was a project to create an ultra simplified webapp version of a Tamagotchi; a popular game in the 90's that involved taking care of a digital monster via actions like feeding or playing with it.

## Instructions
By clicking on the buttons on one of the 4 interaction fields, you'll be able to "play" with your Tamagotchi and effect their stats.
